What is an item?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An item is a logical “thing” that we present on one web page on archive.org. An item may be one video file along with scans of the DVD cover, one book, one audio file, or a set of audio files that represent a CD , etc.

How do you know whether your files should be in one item or separate items?  You get one metadata file per item.  If the same metadata describes ALL of the files (like a CD), then that’s one item.  If the files are too different to have the same metadata (title, creator, description, etc.), they should be in different items.

meta.xml
~~~~~~~~
An item's meta.xml file contains metadata about an item.

files.xml
~~~~~~~~~
An item's files.xml file contains metadata about the files in an item.
